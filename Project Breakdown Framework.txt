1. Project Overview
Project Name: Style Transfer for Rooms
Objective: Enable users to visualize how a room would look in various styles (e.g., modern, contemporary) before remodeling.
Goal: Develop a photorealistic style transfer system that applies different styles to room images using deep learning techniques.
Key Technologies: Neural Networks, Autoencoders, Whitening and Coloring Transforms (WCT), Image Reconstruction, Python, TensorFlow/PyTorch.
2. Project Phases
Phase 1: Research & Planning
1.1 Problem Understanding:

Define the key challenges in remodeling rooms visually.
Explore existing techniques (Gatys NST, Li et al. autoencoders) and analyze their limitations.
1.2 Literature Review:

Study related works on style transfer, especially in photorealistic applications.
Identify advancements such as feature transformations and neural architecture search (NAS).
1.3 Requirements Gathering:

Datasets: Identify relevant datasets (MSCOCO, ADE20K) for training and testing.
Metrics: Define success metrics (Image Reconstruction Loss, Feature Loss, Visual Fidelity).
Phase 2: Data Collection & Preprocessing
2.1 Dataset Acquisition:
Download and clean the MSCOCO and ADE20K datasets.
Filter out irrelevant images (e.g., non-room images in ADE20K).
2.2 Data Augmentation & Preprocessing:
Perform data augmentation to increase training samples (e.g., image rotation, scaling).
Preprocess images for model input (resize, normalization, etc.).
Phase 3: Model Development
3.1 Model Architecture Design:

Autoencoder: Design the core autoencoder model, with VGG-19 as the encoder and a custom decoder.
Whitening and Coloring Transforms (WCT): Implement WCT for style transformation.
Bottleneck Feature Aggregation (BFA): Integrate BFA to improve detail preservation in stylized images.
High-Frequency Residuals: Add skip connections to retain important spatial features.
3.2 Model Training:

Train the model using MSCOCO for content representation and style images.
Perform block training to gradually refine feature transformations.
Fine-tune hyperparameters (learning rate, batch size) and track reconstruction/feature loss.
3.3 Experiments and Comparisons:

Compare results with baseline models (WCT, PhotoWCT2).
Run experiments on different room types and styles.
Evaluate performance using metrics like PSNR, SSIM, and qualitative analysis.
Phase 4: Testing & Validation
4.1 Quantitative Testing:

Measure image reconstruction loss and feature loss on the validation set.
Assess the model’s ability to transfer style while maintaining room structure.
4.2 Qualitative Testing:

Visually inspect the generated images to evaluate realism and aesthetic quality.
Test on various room and style images (e.g., bedroom to modern style, living room to minimalistic style).
4.3 User Feedback:

Conduct user studies or gather feedback from design professionals to validate usability.
Phase 5: Optimization & Refinement
5.1 Model Optimization:

Tune the model to improve efficiency and reduce artifacts (e.g., through more epochs, better loss functions).
Introduce potential GAN-based refinements to enable content structure changes (e.g., furniture modifications).
5.2 Real-World Testing:

Apply the model to real-world room images, potentially taken from customers or open-source databases.
Ensure the model generalizes well to various lighting and furnishing conditions.
Phase 6: Deployment & Future Work
6.1 Deployment:
Package the model into a web or mobile application.
Provide a simple interface where users can upload room photos and apply different styles.
6.2 Future Enhancements:
Explore GAN-based models for style generation.
Expand the model to handle 3D room layouts for enhanced visualization.
Add options for users to modify furniture styles or layout arrangements.
3. Resource Allocation
Team Members: Assign roles for model development, data preprocessing, frontend, etc.
